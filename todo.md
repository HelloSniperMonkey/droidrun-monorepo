# Project Iron Claw: Duolingo Daily Login Bonus

## Phase 1: Core Logic and Setup

- [ ] **Task 1: Project Scaffolding**: Create a new directory `gateway/` for the main application logic.
- [ ] **Task 2: State Management**: Create a file `gateway/daily_bonus_state.json` to store the timestamp of the last login.
- [ ] **Task 3: Main Application Logic**: Create a file `gateway/main.py` that will contain the core logic for the daily login bonus system.
- [ ] **Task 4: Implement Droidrun Interaction**: In `gateway/main.py`, implement the logic to check the last login time and navigate to the Duolingo shop if it's a new day.
- [ ] **Task 5: Background Service**: Implement a background service that periodically checks for the Duolingo app launch.

## Phase 2: Refinement and Deployment

- [ ] **Task 6: Configuration**: Add a `config.yaml` to manage settings like the Duolingo package name.
- [ ] **Task 7: Deployment script**: Create a `run.sh` script to easily start the gateway.
